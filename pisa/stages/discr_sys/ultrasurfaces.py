class ultrasurfaces(Stage):  # pylint: disable=invalid-name
    """
    Service to apply ultrasurface parameterisation stored in a feather file.

    Parameters
    ----------
    fit_results_file : str
        Path to .feather file containing all nominal events with gradients.
    nominal_points : str or dict
        Dictionary (or str that can be evaluated thereto) of the form
        {'parameter_name': <nominal value>} containing the nominal value for each
        parameter that was used to fit the gradients with.
    varnames : list of str
        List of variables to match the pisa events to the pre-fitted events.
    approx_exponential : bool
        Approximate the exponential using exp(x) = 1 + x. This is appropriate when
        gradients have been fit with the purely linear `hardmax` activation function.
        (If you don't know what that is, just leave it at `False`.)
    support : str or dict
        Dictionary (or str that can be evaluated thereto) of the form {'parameter_name':
        (lower bound, upper bound)} containing the bounds of the parameter space inside
        which the gradients are valid. If a value outside of these bounds is requested,
        we have to extrapolate using the strategy defined in the `extrapolation`
        parameter.
    extrapolation : str
        Strategy to use for extrapolating beyond the bounds set by the `bounds` option.
        Options are `continue`, `linear` and `constant`. If `continue`, polynomial
        features are simply extended at the risk of weights getting out of control.
        If `linear`, second order features are extrapolated using their derivative at
        the closest bound. If `constant`, the value at the closest boundary is returned.
    params : ParamSet
        Note that the params required to be in `params` are determined from
        those listed in the `systematics`.
