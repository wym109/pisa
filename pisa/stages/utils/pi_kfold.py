"""
Make K-folds of data.

This stage can be used to split MC into chunks of equal size and to select only one 
chunk to make histograms from. It uses the KFold class from scikit-learn to make
"test" and "train" indeces for the dataset and sets all weights in the "train" 
indeces to zero. Optionally, weights can be re-scaled by the number of splits to
renormalize the total rates.
