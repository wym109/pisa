PISA is a software written to analyze the results (or expected results) of an experiment based on Monte Carlo simulation.

In particular, PISA was written by and for the IceCube Collaboration for analyses employing the [IceCube Neutrino Observatory](https://icecube.wisc.edu/), including the [DeepCore](https://arxiv.org/abs/1109.6096) and the planned [Upgrade]([https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15295](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.09441.pdf)) low-energy in-fill arrays.

> [!NOTE]
> However, any experiment can make use of PISA for analyzing expected and actual results.

PISA was originally developed to cope with low-statistics Monte Carlo (MC) by using parameterizations of the MC and operate on histograms of the data rather than directly reweighting the MC. However, PISA's methods apply equally well to high-MC situations, and PISA also performs traditional reweighted-MC analysis as well.

# Quick start

## Installation

```shell
git clone git@github.com:icecube/pisa.git
cd pisa
pip install -e .
```

For detailed installation instructions and common issues see [Installation](INSTALL.md)

## Minimal Example

Producing some oscillograms


```python
from pisa.core import Pipeline
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

    << PISA is running in single precision (FP32) mode; numba is running on CPU (single core) >>


Instantiate a `Pipeline` or multiple pipelines in a `DistributionMaker` using PISA config files


```python
template_maker = Pipeline("settings/pipeline/osc_example.cfg")
```

Run the pipleine with nominal settings


```python
template_maker.run()
```

Get the oscillation probabilities <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=P_{\nu_\mu\to\nu_\mu}">


```python
outputs = template_maker.data.get_mapset('prob_mu')
```

Plot some results


```python
fig, axes = plt.subplots(figsize=(18, 5), ncols=3)
outputs['nue_cc'].plot(ax=axes[0], cmap='RdYlBu_r', vmin=0, vmax=1);
outputs['numu_cc'].plot(ax=axes[1], cmap='RdYlBu_r', vmin=0, vmax=1);
outputs['nutau_cc'].plot(ax=axes[2], cmap='RdYlBu_r', vmin=0, vmax=1);
```
