Stages
======

Description of the different PISA stages and their physics.

There are stages appropriate for the "staged-approach" analysis technique (note that pid is deprecated)

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   flux
   osc
   aeff
   xsec
   reco
   pid
   discr_sys

Stages that can be used for the MC-reweighting style of analysis

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   mc
   data
   discr_sys
   combine

Finally, the following stages can be used for unfolding analysis (essentially the reverse of the above analyses, which can both be classified as forward-folding):

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   data
   mc
   unfold
